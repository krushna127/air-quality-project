## 📅 Daily Progress Log (Air Quality Prediction Project)

I am keeping track of my learning day by day while working on this project.  
This shows how I improve step by step.

### 🗓️ Day 1
## 📅 Today’s Progress

Today I worked on my **Air Quality Prediction project** as a beginner learning data science.  

- Successfully loaded the dataset in Python using Pandas  
- Fixed column issues so all headers are recognized  
- Cleaned the data: dropped empty columns, filled missing values, and created a `DateTime` column  
- Performed basic Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): histogram of CO levels and correlation heatmap  
- Built my first machine learning model (Linear Regression) to predict CO(GT) using T, RH, AH  
- Printed R² Score and Mean Squared Error (MSE)  
- Prepared a beginner-friendly README.md and started a daily log to track learning progress  

This marks the **first version** of my project, ready to push to GitHub.
